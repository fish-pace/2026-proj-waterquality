# PACE-Fish HackWeek  
## Water Quality parameters in the Gulf of California

</div>


Welcome to our project! This repository contains data and analyses for the FishWeek water quality study in the Gulf of California.  
This study focuses on the use of hyperspectral data from the PACE-OCI mission to investigate the environmental changes experienced by the Gulf on a seasonal basis.

This site and all the materiales have been created for the "Fish-PACE Hackweek 2026" project. 

**Folder Structure**

* `contributor_folders` (optional) Each contributor can make a folder here and 
push their work here during the week. This will allow everyone to see each others work but prevent any merge conflicts.
* `final_notebooks` When the team develops shared final notebooks, they 
can be shared here. Make sure to communicate so that you limit merge conflicts.
* `scripts` Shared scripts or functions can be added here.
* `data` Shared dataset can be shared here. Note, do not put large datasets on GitHub. Speak to the organizers if you 
need to share large datasets. 

## Water Quality

## One-line Description

This project aims to evaluate the spatial and temporal dynamics of water quality in the Northern Gulf of California from June 2024 to June 2025 by integrating NASA’s Plankton, Aerosol, Cloud, ocean Ecosystem (PACE) hyperspectral imagery with other environmental datasets. Hyperspectral reflectance data from PACE will be processed to derive key optically-active water quality parameters, including chlorophyll-a concentration, colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM), and suspended particulate matter (SPM). The results will provide seasonal maps and time series highlighting variability in water quality across the Gulf, improving understanding of ecosystem responses to seasonal forcing and supporting long-term monitoring and management of this highly productive marine system.
