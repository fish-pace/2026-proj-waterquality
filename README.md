# PACE-Fish HackWeek  
## Water Quality parameters in the Gulf of California

</div>


Welcome to our project! This repository contains data and analyses for the FishWeek water quality study in the Gulf of California.  
This study focuses on the use of hyperspectral data from the PACE-OCI mission to investigate the environmental changes experienced by the Gulf on a seasonal basis.

This site and all the materiales have been created for the "Fish-PACE Hackweek 2026" project. 

**Folder Structure**

* `contributor_folders` (optional) Each contributor can make a folder here and 
push their work here during the week. This will allow everyone to see each others work but prevent any merge conflicts.
* `final_notebooks` When the team develops shared final notebooks, they 
can be shared here. Make sure to communicate so that you limit merge conflicts.
* `scripts` Shared scripts or functions can be added here.
* `data` Shared dataset can be shared here. Note, do not put large datasets on GitHub. Speak to the organizers if you 
need to share large datasets.
